# Simple Django App With Leaflet and PostGIS

![The result](https://github.com/natarslan/Simple-Django-App-With-Leaflet-/blob/main/WebProj/CircleMarkersWithPopup.jpg)

This is my first Django web app where I created an interactive map of earthquake data. In the clickable map you can display the location and magnitude information in the popups.

In this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/natarslan/Simple-Django-App-With-Leaflet-/blob/main/SimpleDjangoApp.ipynb) you can see the steps I followed and all the notes I took in order to understand the process of :

- Creating a Django web app
- Uploading an excel file to the server
- Displaying this data on a map
- Change the style of map marker
  - Change icon style to circle
	- Display the circle size dependent on earthquake magnitude
